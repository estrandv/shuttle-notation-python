# Shuttle Notation 
Shuttle Notation is a shorthand script for defining sequential data, with a similar purpose to sheet music.

Shuttle Notation was designed to:
    1. Define sequences of varying complexity quickly, in simple text strings; be easy to type. 
    2. Contain as much information as possible, for each individial element, without becoming hard to read.
    3. Define purpose-agnotic (but always sequential) data, that can be used in several different contexts. 

The main use case is for musical note sequencing, for which the following core features were 
    introduced: 
    1. Syntax for sequences that alternate with each iteration.
    2. Syntax for repeated elements in sequences. 
    3. User-defined, named, numerical arguments for each element in each sequence (such as "amplitude").
    4. Integer-based indices as the defining data of each element in 
        each sequence (such as note numbers in a scale). 

A simple example, denoting a series of notes of the same length with no particular user configuration,
    might look like this: "c4 c4 g4 d4" or like this "1 2 1 2 3".

A more advanced example can instead look like this: 
    "c3:sus3.4 c3:0.5 (a3 / b3:+sus1 / f3 / g3)x2:0.5sus0.2".

This file will give a short introduction to the different functions and elements of Shuttle Notation.
